According to DIGITAL 2025: GLOBAL OVERVIEW REPORT , nearly 56% of online adults make purchases online every week, representing an estimated 1.7 billion people globally. These digital-first behaviors have reshaped not just retail, but also the travel business. In fact, American Express Travel reports that 80% of young travelers rely on social media and mobile apps to plan their trips. For this generation, booking is no longer just a transaction,it's part of the travel experience itself. This shift offers businesses a unique opportunity to digitally deliver personalized experiences that drive engagement and growth. Immersive Sports, Moments We Can Join Recently, activities like mini golf, darts, and water sports have gained rapid popularity among Gen Z and Millennial travelers. These experiences are highly interactive and visually engagingâ€”making them ideal for social media content. Their shareable nature encourages young travelers to not only participate but also capture, post, and spread the experience online, turning every outing into both entertainment and exposure. For example, SeaBunny Scubacations in the Celebes Sea offers immersive water activities like snorkeling, scuba diving, and mermaid-style exploration. These visually striking and shareable experiences combine challenge and funâ€”making them especially appealing to young travelers eager to create unforgettable memories. For young travelers, unique and shareable experiences are what stand out most. Film Locations, Stories You Can Step Into According to The State of Social Media in Travel 2025, approximately four out of five Millennials use social media for travel inspiration. Platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok often showcase cinematic or story-driven content that resonates with younger generations. They donâ€™t just want to see the highlightsâ€”they want to step into the story, feel the atmosphere, and immerse themselves in the emotion of the scene. For example, Be a SAMURAI offers customers the chance to wear traditional armor and step into scenes inspired by historical film footage. Visitors can role-play as samurai characters and participate in a re-enactment that feels like a scene from a period drama. For young travelers, meaningful travel is a deep, immersive experienceâ€”one that lets them step into the story. Bucket-List Adventures,The Dreams They ChaseÂ  The most exciting adventures are the most meaningful ones. According to Booking.com survey data , up to 68% of Gen Z travelers say they prioritize unique, adventurous experiencesâ€”such as hot air balloon rides or skydiving. These activities offer more than just thrills; they create unforgettable, emotional memories that define what meaningful travel means to them. For example, Balloon Adventure Thailand offers a sunrise flight over Chiang Mai, an unforgettable, dream-list experience for many young travelers. For young travelers, the most meaningful adventures are unforgettable and dream-worthy. Hyperlocal Travel, Real Cultural Connection Experience comes first when choosing a travel destination in the younger generation. Safety and distance are no longer top priorities. According to McKinsey & Companyâ€™s report The evolving role of experiences in travel , the desire to connect with local culture has become one of the leading reasons people choose where to go. Emotion-driven, personal travel is on the rise, and local experiences are now seen as essential. For example, Elephant Inwild Sanctuary in Thailand , visitors can feed, bathe, and care for elephants in their natural habitat. This hands-on experience, which includes a traditional mud spa activity, lets travelers connect deeply with local values and create lasting emotional memories. For young travelers,cultural connection is what makes a journey meaningful. Take-Home Culture, Lasting Travel Memories The meaning of souvenirs is changing for todayâ€™s travelers. According to the 2025 Global Travel Trends Report , up to 82% of Gen Z and Millennial travelers are looking for unique items that represent their travel experiences. This trend reflects a growing preference for hands-on, culturally rooted activities that let them create meaningful, personalized memories. For example, Cookinn Taiwan , travelers get hands-on with local traditionsâ€”making their own souvenirs while learning to make delicious food like a local. For young travelers, itâ€™s this kind of creative, take-home experience that turns a trip into something personal and unforgettable.

      "Based on the analysis of current trends and sources, here are the key likes and dislikes of Gen Z travelers in North America regarding their travel experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Likes:\n",
      "1. **Immersive and Unique Experiences**: Gen Z shows a strong preference for immersive activities that allow them to engage deeply with local cultures. They prioritize activities like cooking classes, local crafts, and adventure sports over traditional sightseeing.\n",
      "2. **Cultural Authenticity and Hyperlocal Travel**: They prefer destinations that provide cultural connections, favoring local traditions and authentic experiences over conventional tourist attractions.\n",
      "3. **Social Media Sharing**: Experiences that can be easily shared on platforms like Instagram or TikTok are particularly appealing, driving their choices towards visually engaging activities.\n",
      "4. **Sustainability and Ethics**: Gen Z travelers are more likely to choose brands and destinations that align with their values of sustainability and social responsibility, often willing to spend more if they believe their choices are environmentally friendly.\n",
      "5. **Flexibility and Spontaneity**: Many Gen Z travelers enjoy the flexibility in their travel plans, often booking trips last minute and appreciating options that allow spontaneous changes to itineraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Dislikes:\n",
      "1. **Conventional and Overly Touristy Destinations**: Gen Z tends to shy away from mainstream tourist hotspots, preferring undiscovered places that offer unique experiences.\n",
      "2. **High Costs and Lack of Value**: They are price-sensitive and seek good deals but are willing to pay a premium for experiences they perceive as valuable or unique. Poor value for money in standard tourist offerings can deter them.\n",
      "3. **Bureaucratic Processes**: Many express frustration with complicated travel arrangements, such as visas or other travel restrictions that impede their ability to travel freely or spontaneously.\n",
      "4. **Corporate and Sterile Environments**: Gen Z is generally averse to environments that feel commercial or impersonal, such as large chain hotels lacking unique features or character.\n",

      "Travel Articles Destinations Type of Trip Type of Traveller Outdoor & Nature Things To Do Travel Predictions 2023 6 min read December 1, 2022 Travelers are set to make 2023 a big year for getting out and exploring the world. Excited about the year ahead, Booking.com has conducted extensive research to reveal the travel trends of 2023, including where travelers want to go, their inspirations for traveling, and how budget plays a big role in their plans. 2023 will be the year of reimagining travel As the world adapts to “the new normal” following a period of limited international travel and national lockdowns, travelers are eager to get out and see the world in earnest. As travel restrictions and Covid testing become a thing of the past, research reveals that 73% of people are more optimistic about travel than they were in 2022. While we head into 2023 in the midst of global economic and political uncertainty, almost three-quarters (72%) said traveling is still worth it. The most popular types of vacations and experiences in 2023 For many, a change of scenery and a chance to soak in some sun is enough of a reason to go on vacation. However, 2023 is likely to see a shift in why we’re looking to get away, as well as the types of vacations we take. Peace and pleasure pilgrimages A vacation is a great way to unwind and relax, but in 2023 many travelers want to take it one step further and use their adventures to treat their minds, bodies and souls. 42% of travelers want to go on a break that focuses on their mental and physical health, including retreats to smooth the processes of pregnancy and menopause. Almost half (44%) want to go on meditation or mindfulness retreats. Meanwhile, some travelers want to treat their bodies in other ways. Over a third (36%) want to go on an erotic escape and explore new kinks and ways of experiencing pleasure. 36% also revealed they want to try out psychedelic experiences with the help of cannabis or psychedelics like mushrooms or ayahuasca. This means 2023 could see more travelers heading to more countries where certain types of psychedelics are permitted, such as The Netherlands or Brazil . Virtual reality inspiring travel choices  While the world isn’t ready to embrace sci-fi movie-esque travel just yet, it offers travelers a glimpse of what they can expect to see. 43% will use virtual reality to inspire their choices, with 46% more likely to travel somewhere they otherwise wouldn’t have if they could experience it virtually first. However, some are keen to spend multiple days in the Metaverse, with over a third (35%) revealing they’d take a multi-day AR or VR travel experience. As haptic feedback technology advances, virtual travelers will soon be able to feel the sand between their toes and the sun on their skin without even having to step outside. While this sounds exciting, it’s not enough to dissuade the majority (60%) of travelers, who agree that virtual travel isn’t as fulfilling as being there in person. This means our 2023 travel predictions don’t include travelers swapping sunglasses for VR goggles for the most part. Taking travel off-grid Following various international lockdowns in which many people weren’t allowed to leave their homes, let alone travel, we became reliant on technology for entertainment. Now that most restrictions have been lifted, travelers are keen to disconnect, with 55% wanting to spend their vacations off-grid. Survival! But it doesn’t just stop at wanting to disconnect from technology, with more and more people craving a back-to-basics experience, many travelers are expressing a desire to use their vacations in 2023 as an opportunity to learn survival skills (58%). This includes learning how to source clean water (53%), light a fire from scratch (42%), forage for food in the wild (39%) and even how to prep for an apocalypse (39%). Connecting with nature  Sitting in front of a cozy, crackling fireplace somewhere deep in the woods and miles from the nearest microchip is many travelers’ idea of bliss. However, almost half (48%) would only consider going off-grid if it meant they could take a few luxuries and indulgences with them, and 53% revealed they’d need their phone and stable internet connection. Looking for culture shocks  Many of us live our lives in a certain routine, and that includes our vacations. However, travelers are looking for a break from their routines, and 50% want to experience a culture shock in 2023. Embracing the unfamiliar  When you find somewhere you enjoy traveling to, it can be tempting to revisit that same place on your next vacation, but in 2023 travelers intend to mix things up. Almost three-quarters (73%) want to experience travel out of their comfort zone, with 30% keen to explore lesser-known cities to find some hidden gems. Plenty of travelers (38%) want an out-of-this-world culture shock, and to go on the hunt for UFOs. This means there will likely be an increase in visitors to extra-terrestrial hotspots such as [Roswell, New Mexico](https://www.booking.com/city/us/roswell.html). Meanwhile, others may go further east: 47% of travelers are interested in exploring exotic delicacies such as the hottest chili pepper (the current world record is held by the California Reaper, bred in Rock Hill, South Carolina). Budget-savvy traveling With the global economy not showing any immediate signs of improvement as we head into 2023, travelers are becoming more budget-conscious, with 68% paying close attention to how much they’re spending on their adventures. However, despite the ongoing economic and energy crises, half (50%) say investing in a vacation is still a top priority. Prioritizing travel spend  Following travel restrictions in 2020 and 2021, many travelers were able to save the money they would have otherwise spent on vacation. As a result, half (49%) will make up for it by spending more during their 2023 adventures, while 43% plan on indulging by splashing the cash to maximize their experience. A third (33%) revealed they like to indulge in shopping on vacation for things that aren’t available back home. How are travelers saving money when booking vacations? While many intend on living their best life while on vacation, travelers are finding ways to spend less in order to get there. Almost two-thirds (63%) will keep a close eye on deals and hacks, with more than half (53%) happy to travel off-season or via longer routes. That means 2023’s off-season may be a little busier than last year’s, while the summer may be somewhat quieter than usual. This may help spread the crowds at busy attractions such as Walt Disney World . 61% of people also intend on planning their vacations further in advance, so expect to see fewer last-minute travelers in 2023. Embracing ‘real life’ work travel The pandemic allowed businesses to see the positive impact remote working could have, which led to many employers embracing a “work from anywhere” mentality. While employees have enjoyed hitting the beach during their lunch hour or working on their laptops by the pool, working while traveling trends are set to change in 2023. Two-thirds (66%) of people want their trips to be strictly work-free in 2023. This is despite the 51% of people who want their employer to use the money saved from remote working to fund corporate travel or retreats.  Perhaps this is something businesses should consider, as 59% believe exploring somewhere new will inspire them to be more productive at work and 44% believe that ‘real life’ work trips help bring people together.  Nostalgic escapes Over the last couple of years, popular culture has seen a nostalgia resurgence of sorts, with 80s and 90s coming back into fashion. It seems as though the same will happen with travel in 2023, with almost nine in ten (88%) wanting to go on a nostalgic getaway. 23% of travelers want to escape to simpler times, when all we had to worry about was rewinding that rented VHS and how long the lines were for Space Mountain. 61% of travelers want to get their hearts racing with a trip to a theme park in 2023, with more than half (54%) planning on taking a family reunion-focused vacation. That means theme parks such as [Universal Orlando Resort](https://www.booking.com/district/us/orlando/universalstudios.html) may be visited by multi-generational families in 2023.

      "Uvika Wahi\n",
      "Updated on: February 21, 2024\n",
      "Airbnb Industry News\n",
      "Airbnb has set its sights on a trio of strategic priorities for 2023: Make Hosting Mainstream, Perfect the Core Service, and Expand Beyond the Core . Are the company’s aspirations bearing fruit?\n",
      "Discover the captivating story behind Airbnb’s evolution in this in-depth analysis.\n",
      "Make Hosting Mainstream\n",
      "Since 2021, Airbnb has been actively engaged in an initiative to educate the public about the distinctive aspects of hosting through their “ Made Possible by Hosts ” commercial series. This outreach has been part of the company’s effort to distinguish its brand by focusing on hosting as a core differentiator.\n",
      "In 2022, they doubled down on this strategy by introducing the Airbnb Setup program, designed to expedite the onboarding process for new hosts.\n",
      "In 2023, Airbnb re-embraced its core identity, positioning itself as the go-to platform for an effortless transition into hosting. Under the banner of ‘Make Hosting Mainstream’, this objective involved elevating host awareness, streamlining onboarding processes, and enriching support tools. The overarching aim was crystal clear: establish Airbnb as the simplest path to converting your residence into a supplementary income stream through guest accommodations. It went about it in the following ways:\n",
      "Airbnb It\n",
      "In 2023, Airbnb’s campaign to make hosting mainstream is evident in its “ Airbnb it” advertising campaign , which aims to attract occasional hosts, including those offering private rooms and guest houses. The campaign’s impact is reflected in a doubling of visits to the host landing page since its launch.\n",
      "Airbnb Rooms\n",
      "A notable shift in 2023 is the introduction of “Airbnb Rooms, ” a strategic move that highlights Airbnb’s reinvigorated emphasis on private room rentals – a domain that had previously defined the platform’s identity.\n",
      "From Q3 2021 to Q3 2022, private room listings witnessed a substantial 31% increase, demonstrating a rising demand for this accommodation type.\n",
      "While Airbnb introduced the “private room” category on its platform in late 2022, it was only in 2023 that the company made it more prominent on the platform and rebranded this and related efforts as Airbnb Rooms .\n",
      "This strategic return to its roots not only addresses the perception of being costly but also bolsters the supply, ushering in a new chapter for Airbnb’s offerings.\n",
      "Converting More Guests Into Hosts Than Ever\n",
      "Airbnb’s strategy of leveraging its guest base to bolster supply is a recurring theme. By tapping into its extensive customer network, Airbnb has managed to turn 36% of newly available hosts into hosts who were once guests themselves . This approach highlights the platform’s ability to cultivate growth from within its existing user pool.\n",
      "Did Airbnb ‘Make Hosting Mainstream’ in Q2 2023?\n",
      "Airbnb’s Q2 2023 data holds key insights that vividly align with the company’s first goal of “Making Hosting Mainstream.”\n",
      "Supply Growth Surge: The data reveals a significant 19% year-over-year increase in active listings during Q2 2023. This robust supply growth underscores Airbnb’s commitment to expanding hosting opportunities, enabling a broader range of hosts to join the platform.\n",
      "Diverse Market Expansion: Across all regions, market types, and price points, Airbnb witnessed double-digit supply growth. This widespread surge signifies the platform’s proactive approach to attracting hosts from various backgrounds, contributing to the mainstreaming of hosting.\n",
      "Historical Milestone: Q2 2023 witnessed a remarkable achievement as Airbnb added more net active listings than any previous quarter, surpassing a noteworthy 7 million total active listings . This accomplishment directly supports the goal of making hosting a widespread and accessible endeavor, appealing to a larger host community.\n",
      "Strategic Urban Rebound: Recent data reveals a remarkable 20% growth in urban listings, surpassing the 19% growth rate of traditional vacation rental listings. The COVID pandemic pushed Airbnb into traditional vacation rental markets, as demand for city stays collapsed. The fact that urban is growing fast shows that Airbnb’s former core engine, urban, is ticking again.\n",
      "Perfect the Core Service\n",
      "Central to Airbnb’s ambitions for 2023 is the goal to “Perfect the Core Service.” This aspiration revolves around refining the bedrock of Airbnb’s offerings – short-term stays of less than 28 days mostly in North America and Western Europe – to provide users with an even more satisfying and seamless experience. This mission involves addressing user concerns, streamlining processes, and boosting the overall value proposition. Here are the key focus areas:\n",
      "Boosting Support: Airbnb is ramping up user assistance, ensuring prompt resolutions to queries and concerns. This step reinforces trust and reliability among users.\n",
      "Simplifying Home Selection: Airbnb strives to make finding the right accommodation effortless. Through smarter search tools and personalized suggestions, Airbnb wants to ensure users find their ideal stay with ease.\n",
      "Maximizing Value: Airbnb aims to strike the right balance between affordability and quality. By refining pricing tools and offering insights for competitive pricing, Airbnb intends to provide more value to its users.\n",
      "So what does perfection look like?\n",
      "So far, Airbnb has already made headway toward making substantial changes to its core service, and here are the most important ones:\n",
      "The introduction of over 50 new features and upgrades during the 2023 Summer Release , underlines  Airbnb’s responsiveness to user feedback and commitment to an evolving user-centric framework.\n",
      "A redesign of pricing tools , aimed at mitigating the challenges faced by hosts in determining competitive prices. The integration of pricing tools into a unified calendar framework enhances user convenience and pricing clarity.\n",
      "The rollout of an innovative “View Similar Listings” feature, provides hosts with a benchmarking tool for competitive pricing strategies. This initiative resonates with Airbnb’s endeavor to augment host competitiveness within the marketplace.\n",
      "Empowering Travel Planning with Enhanced Wishlists\n",
      "Airbnb understands that wishlists are not mere gadgets; they signify desirability. For instance, within the Host Dashboard, Airbnb provides hosts with insights into how frequently their listings have been added to wishlists—a metric of considerable importance to Airbnb.\n",
      "The data indicates that over 50% of wishlisted bookings originate from travelers engaging in intricate, multi-destination journeys, often spanning international destinations. To enhance the value of wishlists in shaping these elaborate and diverse travel itineraries, Airbnb has introduced a range of new features.\n",
      "The newly added features facilitate seamless wishlist usage, making it simpler for guests to meticulously plan and execute remarkable trips:\n",
      "Save with a Single Tap : Guests can now save new homes to their Wishlist with a single tap while conducting searches.\n",
      "See Availability at a Glance: A new availability calendar provides guests with means to adjust their travel dates. This calendar instantly displays the homes that are available for their chosen period, facilitating efficient trip planning.\n",
      "Add Notes to Saved Homes: Guests have the option to attach personal notes to the homes they’ve saved in their Wishlist, enabling travelers to jot down reminders, preferences, or reasons why a particular place caught their interest, ensuring a seamless recall of each home’s unique appeal.\n",
      "These improvements are good, but they still have a long way to catch up to Vrbo’s Trip Board . On Trip Board, for instance, you can invite people to see your wishlist and vote for their favorite options, which helps groups plan trips together better.\n",
      "Introducing Only On Airbnb\n",
      "Airbnb has consistently excelled at garnering free PR through creative initiatives like spending a night in a floating house on the Thames in London , booking an entire island in Belize , or enjoying stays in unique locations like Le Louvre Museum . \\\n",
      "Airbnb’s “ Only On Airbnb ” program offers exclusive, standout listings, embodying the platform’s commitment to unique experiences, kickstarting it with the Barbie Malibu DreamHouse.\n",
      "Interestingly this is Airbnb’s second Hollywood collaboration, close on the heels of the company’s campaign with Gwyneth Paltrow.\n",
      "It’s also likely the first time Airbnb has transformed a property to ride the wave of a trend, as seen with the Barbie-themed experience, rather than simply highlighting existing listings that already offer something special.\n",
      "Barbie Malibu DreamHouse: An Iconic Collaboration\n",
      "Teaming up with Warner Bros. and Mattel, Airbnb transformed a home into the iconic Barbie Malibu DreamHouse. This standout offering under the “Only On Airbnb” program garnered global attention.\n",
      "Global Pop Culture Impact\n",
      "The program taps into significant global pop culture moments, captivating guests with extraordinary accommodations. The Barbie Malibu DreamHouse achieved remarkable success, becoming Airbnb’s most popular listing ever, with 13,000 press features and over 250 million social media impressions.\n",
      "Expanding Horizons and Distinctive Introduction\n",
      "“Only On Airbnb” campaigns effectively introduce unique stays to new guests, surpassing the press coverage of Airbnb’s IPO. These campaigns are pivotal in extending Airbnb’s reach and showcasing its unmatched offerings.\n",
      "The triumph of the “Only On Airbnb” program underscores its role in shaping Airbnb’s future. As the company evolves, these exclusive campaigns will continue to captivate audiences, representing an integral part of Airbnb’s strategic direction.\n",
      "Expand beyond the Core:\n",
      "Airbnb’s strategy for evolving beyond its core short-term rental model in the U.S. encompasses a wide array of initiatives that prioritize enhancing the Airbnb experience, capitalizing on emerging market trends, and unlocking new growth opportunities.\n",
      "Global Expansion\n",
      "One major focus of Airbnb’s growth strategy is its deliberate expansion into international markets . Recognizing its subpar performance in key countries such as Germany, Brazil, Japan, and South Korea, Airbnb has taken substantial steps to address these gaps. While it is difficult to comment exactly how badly its platform was lagging, noteworthy progress has since been achieved.\n",
      "Airbnb’s approach to growth is straightforward: excel in what you do best, but do it in more countries. An essential facet of this strategy involves international expansion, which is seen as the most readily attainable avenue for increased growth.\n",
      "This has proven to be successful in countries like Germany and Brazil, where the company has employed a comprehensive strategy that includes brand development, public relations, social media, and partnerships with local celebrities. These successful tactics are now being expanded to Asian markets like Japan and South Korea. Additionally, Airbnb stresses the need to localize its product in these markets, particularly in relation to adapting to local payment methods.\n",
      "North America\n",
      "In spite of a marginal 1% decrease in Average Daily Rate (ADR), this region has seen strong growth in bookings, supported by a 20% increase in cross-border bookings.\n",
      "EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa)\n",
      "Despite a tough comparison to the prior year, EMEA witnessed an 8% rise in ADR and a 15% increase in cross-border bookings. Particularly in Germany, Airbnb’s efforts have led to a significant 63% increase in bookings compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n",
      "Latin America\n",
      "Identified as Airbnb’s fastest-growing region, this area has seen bookings surge by 22% Year on Year. Notably, Airbnb’s targeted investment in Brazil has resulted in robust growth, with bookings skyrocketing by 110% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n",
      "Asia Pacific\n",
      "This region, including key markets like Japan and South Korea, has experienced the highest growth at 24% YoY. Despite having more supply than demand in these specific markets, Airbnb’s focused strategy has led to an uptick in bookings.\n",
      "Facilitating Longer Stays\n",
      "Since the early months of COVID, Airbnb has emphasized longer stays (over 28 days). What’s clear now is that even after the pandemic, the demand for extended stays remains strong. Airbnb has recognized this trend and is capitalizing on it.\n",
      "The shift towards longer stays is evident in the numbers. The percentage of monthly stays has increased from 13% before the pandemic to a steady 18%. This points to a changing preference for more flexible work and living arrangements.\n",
      "Further Expanding Monthly Stays\n",
      "Airbnb’s commitment to catering to diverse traveler needs is evident through its efforts to bolster Monthly Stays. In May, the platform took a series of strategic steps to render extended stays more economical and accessible, marking a notable shift in its service offerings. The key developments in this endeavor include:\n",
      "Fee Reduction for Long-Term Stays: Significant reduction of guest service fees for stays surpassing three months, enhancing affordability.\n",
      "Pay by Bank: Introduction of a novel payment option for U.S. guests, encouraging cost-effective bookings exceeding one month.\n",
      "Streamlined Monthly Discounts: Enhanced process for Hosts to apply monthly discounts, making extended stays more enticing.\n",
      "The user experience for monthly stays was further elevated through intuitive improvements, including a revamped dial interface. This intuitive feature empowers guests to seamlessly search for stays ranging from 1 to 12 months, simplifying the process of finding the perfect extended accommodation.\n",
      "Enhancing Experiences\n",
      "Contrary to rumors in publications like Skift , Airbnb seems still committed to Experiences. As part of Airbnb’s expansion strategy, the company aims to develop and scale up its ‘Experiences’ offering. This is where local hosts can provide unique, curated activities for guests. Considering the high satisfaction rates tied to these experiences, this represents a significant opportunity for growth.\n",
      "Additional Services for Hosts and Guests\n",
      "In his talk, Chesky also alludes to potential services that could be offered to both hosts and guests. Among these potential offerings, he mentions the prospects of an advertising platform for hosts, as well as a co-host marketplace. The latter envisions a connection between hosts seeking properties and homeowners with limited hosting availability.\n",
      "Interestingly, this concept of a co-hosting platform isn’t new . Several weeks ago we broke the news that such a platform is already operational in select US states, and it has been active in various European countries for some time. However, the relatively vague allusions imply that Airbnb wishes to be discreet about it.\n",
      "Moreover, for guests, Chesky envisions a range of services comparable to those found in hotels or resorts, indicating a broader scope for Airbnb’s evolution.\n",
      "Utilizing AI and New Tech\n",
      "Acknowledging AI as a generational shift in technology, Chesky sees vast potential for its integration into Airbnb’s future offerings, though he does not elaborate much on the specifics.\n",
      "These initiatives are then prioritized based on the concept of “perishable opportunities,” emphasizing immediate action on the most promising and time-sensitive opportunities. For instance, introducing advertising on the platform is considered valuable, but not a priority due to its non-perishable nature.\n",
      "Importantly, Airbnb is committed to maintaining a balanced ecosystem of hosts. It is crucial for the company to ensure new features or services, such as the proposed advertising platform, cater to the needs of all hosts – individual or professional.\n",
      "Impact of Enhancements\n",
      "The strategic enhancements in Monthly Stays yielded impactful outcomes during the quarter, as evidenced through:\n",
      "Surge in Year-over-Year Bookings: Notable rise in year-over-year bookings for monthly stays, reflecting heightened traveler interest.\n",
      "Preference for Extended Stays: Increase in guests opting for stays lasting three months or more, with June’s figures reaching approximately 25% of total monthly stays, compared to 18% in April.\n",
      "Rise in Monthly Discounts: Substantial growth in the percentage of new active listings offering monthly discounts, from 22% to approximately 50% since the 2023 Summer Release.\n",
      "These strides in the realm of Monthly Stays underscore Airbnb’s responsiveness to evolving traveler preferences, demonstrating its commitment to providing a diverse array of accommodation options tailored to the needs of modern nomads.\n",
      "BONUS: Airbnb, A Matchmaker?\n",
      "Amidst its evolving role as a company, we can’t help but ponder if Airbnb might make a play for matchmaking for long-term stays, akin to finding roommates. This speculation arises from several interconnected factors:\n",
      "Airbnb’s broader mission to combat loneliness , a theme that has resonated prominently in their recent campaign alongside Gwyneth Paltrow.\n",
      "Airbnb’s existing offering of housing solutions through Airbnb Friendly Apartments , implies a potential alignment with the concept of matchmaking for co-living arrangements.\n",
      "Airbnb’s evolving strategy, including a focus on private room rentals and curated guest experiences, the notion of extending this to long-term, harmonious co-living arrangements feels plausible.\n",
      "While this proposition is purely speculative, the convergence of these elements prompts us to envision Airbnb’s potential role in facilitating secure, well-matched co-living partnerships. This concept, resonating with Airbnb’s values of innovation and community-building, could offer a captivating avenue for the company’s future exploration.\n",

      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **1. Expedia**\n",
      "**Market Position:**  \n",
      "Expedia Group is a leader in the online travel industry, offering a wide range of travel services, including booking accommodations, flights, car rentals, and vacation packages. It is focused on both B2C and B2B markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "- **Comprehensive Offerings:** Expedia provides extensive travel services, allowing users to plan entire trips in one place—including flights, hotels, car rentals, and activities.\n",
      "- **Brand Recognition:** As one of the oldest travel agencies online, it has strong brand recognition and consumer trust.\n",
      "- **Budget-Friendly Options:** Regular promotions and discounts cater to price-sensitive travelers, appealing to Gen Z who seek good value.\n",
      "  \n",
      "**Weaknesses:**\n",
      "- **Complex Interface:** Some users find the interface overwhelming with options, which could deter less experienced travelers.\n",
      "- **Less Focus on Unique Experiences:** Traditionally, Expedia has been more focused on standard hotel offerings and may not cater specifically to Gen Z’s demand for immersive and unique experiences as effectively as its competitors.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Booking.com**\n",
      "**Market Position:**  \n",
      "Booking.com is one of the most widely used platforms for travelers seeking accommodations globally. It has successfully expanded its offerings beyond just hotels to include apartments and unique stays.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "- **Diverse Accommodation Types:** Offers hotels, homes, and unique properties, catering to a broad range of preferences.\n",
      "- **User-Friendly Interface:** The highly intuitive interface eases the booking process, particularly attractive to tech-savvy Gen Z travelers.\n",
      "- **Focus on Experiences:** Engaging with local experiences and adventures, Booking.com aligns well with Gen Z's preference for hyperlocal and immersive travel experiences, including cultural connections.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weaknesses:**\n",
      "- **Market Saturation:** Faces strong competition from platforms like Airbnb and local OTA alternatives, which may impact growth.\n",
      "- **Limited Control Over Unique Properties:** While diverse, the quality and uniqueness of offered properties may not always meet Gen Z’s high expectations for authenticity.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **3. Airbnb**\n",
      "**Market Position:**  \n",
      "Airbnb has carved a niche in the travel market by offering unique accommodations and local experiences not typically provided by hotels, targeting those who desire authentic cultural interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "- **Unique Inventory:** Airbnb provides a vast array of unique listings, including homes, treehouses, and even experiences catered to local culture, drawing in Gen Z's thirst for immersive adventures.\n",
      "- **Local Host Interactions:** Enables connections with local hosts, fulfilling Gen Z's desire for meaningful cultural experiences.\n",
      "- **Strong Brand Engagement:** Airbnb’s marketing strategies, including partnerships with cultural icons, resonate well with Gen Z, often generating viral social media content.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weaknesses:**\n",
      "- **Quality Control Issues:** Varied quality across listings can lead to inconsistencies in the user experience, which can be frustrating for travelers seeking reliability.\n",
      "- **Increased Regulatory Scrutiny:** Airbnb is facing growing regulations in many cities worldwide, affecting availability and pricing, which can dissuade potential users.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Conclusion**\n",
      "In summary, travelers—especially Gen Z—are focused on unique and immersive experiences that foster cultural connections. Both Airbnb and Booking.com cater effectively to these preferences with their unique listings and local perspectives. Expedia, while strong in conventional offerings, must enhance its focus on unique experiences to remain competitive in this evolving market landscape. Each platform has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different traveler demographics and preferences within the broader travel ecosystem.\n",

      "Strategies for reaching the next-generation traveler\n",
      "By the BlackDog Ad Strategy team\n",
      "Image created using generative AI\n",
      "In addition to my day job as creative director at an ad agency, I’m also a youth sports coach. The teens I coach, as well as my own two children, belong to a generation that is commonly referred to as Generation Z (Gen Z). The opportunity to spend time with this group has not only been a privilege but an invaluable learning experience as well. They are, for the most part, design savvy, opinionated, proficient researchers, and they have access to more instantaneous information than any generation before them. Unlike my generation of Xers, who as children were rarely involved in family travel decisions, Gen Z is heavily involved in family vacation planning, and their interest is not exclusive to amusement parks and attractions. If you manage a brand that relies on tourists, then Gen Z is most probably an emerging market with whom you need to develop a marketing strategy.\n",
      "Who are they?\n",
      "As of 2024, Gen Z made up 30% of the global population. The first Gen Zs were born after 1996, and they differ from their forebears on many fronts. For instance, millennials currently are being segmented by life stage (single, married, couple, etc.), which is in stark contrast with the narrow life stage that describes Gen Z. The one common thread that binds Gen Z is they are the most digitally connected generation yet. Gen Z is sometimes referred to as iGen, because they don’t recognize a world without iPhones & high-speed internet.\n",
      "Key family decision-makers\n",
      "Although the majority aren’t old enough to vacation on their own, Gen Z is highly influential within their family dynamic. Because they’ve been raised in a household where their opinions carry weight, they have a big say in how the travel plans are made. You can even see this in the trend of destination birthdays, where kids get to choose among several locations that fit within mom and dad’s budget. For example, this summer my children took it upon themselves to help plan our family vacation. They researched hotels, flights, and points of interest via blogs, videos, social influencers, and consumer reviews. The result was a vacation that everyone in our entire family was invested in, and frankly a better researched and planned vacation than I would have done on my own.\n",
      "Older Gen Z travelers are careful spenders\n",
      "Current research indicates that older Gen Z-ers are decidedly more frugal than their predecessors. They are shown to be a group that seeks to travel, but they are looking for the most bang for their buck. As one would expect, they look to the web and social media for suggestions and consultations. They read reviews as well as write them, don’t limit themselves to organic search and look for destinations that are highly Instagrammable.\n",
      "They understand they have brand choices\n",
      "Gen Z is highly brand aware but is very malleable, jumping from one brand to another so long as those brands are speaking their language and have a distinct set of benefits that are important to them. Gen Z can be influenced by other factors not related to name recognition, such as their preference for experiences over material goods. When they travel, they are eager to do as the locals do and interact with others they’ve never met before, even if that interaction is digital in nature. This is why it is crucial to reach this group through the screens they hold in their hands.\n",
      "Bringing the experience to life on digital\n",
      "Suffice it to say, they respond to user-generated content from friends and social media influencers over what they see as traditional advertising messages. In fact, they see right through paid actors and scripted marketing, instead opting for relatable messaging through digital channels. They were born online, remember? Travel brands that want to corral this group often pepper the internet with bucket-list worthy blogs that speak to them about places they want to explore. Instagram is a very viable and beneficial channel to display carefully curated content in the travel industry because Gen Z is as ‘Grammable’ as they come. Moreover, since they are watching YouTube more than TV, travel brands and influencers are directing more and more resources toward producing video content. However, make sure to keep your message short, as this group is accustomed to scanning through feeds at breakneck speed. Even Tripadvisor has recognized the importance of social media within travel and is revamping the platform to be more social in nature.\n",
      "Your brand’s future\n",
      "For travel marketers, Gen Z is the next frontier. Millennials were “pioneers” in the digital age. Gen Z’s, on the other hand, are “settlers.” Don’t market to them as if they are merely Millennials 2.0. They grew up in the smartphone universe, with the power of all the world’s information in the palm of their hands. They expect technology; they have a great sense of design aesthetics and are hard to impress. As you reach out to Gen Z, be creative, be real, make sure you hear what they are saying, and involve them in your brand’s conversation. So with your new Gen Z-focused marketing strategy at hand, your travel and tourism business will be ready to embrace the next big audience of travelers.\n",
