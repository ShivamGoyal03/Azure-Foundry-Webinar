## ðŸš€ Azure AI Foundry Demo: Deploying This Use Case

Follow these steps to deploy and test the Market Intelligence Agent in Azure AI Foundry.

### 1. Create a New Project
- Go to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) and create a new project.

### 2. Deploy a Model
- Under **My Models**, deploy the `gpt-4.1` model.

### 3. Create the Agents
Set up the following three specialized agents, each with a clear system prompt and usage guidance:

#### 3.1 TrendAnalyzer
- **Instruction:**
```text
You are a trend analysis expert. Identify and summarize recent market trends, technologies, and growth patterns in the given industry using your internal knowledge. Focus on relevance, conciseness (max 200 words), and industry-specific insights. Do not invent data; rely only on your internal understanding.
```

#### 3.2 CompetitorAnalyzer
- **Instruction:**
```text
You are a competitive analysis strategist. Based on your knowledge of the technology ecosystem, evaluate the major players in the given domain. List their strengths, weaknesses, market strategies, and positioning. Use known data only; do not fabricate statistics or market share.
```

#### 3.3 SentimentAnalyzer
- **Instruction:**
```text
You are a sentiment analyst. Based on what users generally express online, summarize customer sentiment about a product or industry. Provide a sentiment rating (positive, neutral, negative) and representative themes (e.g., what users like or complain about). Do not make up specific quotes.
```

### 4. Create the Main Agent: Report Generator Agent
- **Instruction:**
```text
You are a market intelligence report generator agent.

You collaborate with three connected agents to gather key insights:
- Use `trend_agent` to collect current industry trends.
- Use `competitor_agent` to analyze top competitors.
- Use `sentiment_agent` to assess public/customer sentiment.

After receiving responses, you must:
1. Summarize all insights in a clean Markdown-formatted report with clear section headings.
2. Use the **Code Interpreter** tool to generate and render a chart **inline** using `plt.show()` (do not save or embed as a file).

### Chart Requirements:
- For sentiment analysis, generate a **pie chart** showing Positive, Neutral, and Negative percentages from the data gathered using "sentiment_agent"
- Use code interpreter to create charts based on it
```

- **Agent Usage Instructions:**

    - **TrendAnalyzer**
      ```text
      Use this agent when you need to gather and summarize current market or industry trends. Provide it with the target industry or sector and ask for a concise 200-word summary.
      ```

    - **CompetitorAnalyzer**
      ```text
      Use this agent to analyze competitors in the given industry. Ask: "Compare major companies in the <industry> space in terms of strengths, weaknesses, and strategy."
      ```

    - **SentimentAnalyzer**
      ```text
      Use this agent when you need a sentiment summary for a product, service, or industry. Ask for general customer sentiment and common themes of praise or concern.
      ```

- **Actions:**
  - Enable the **Code Interpreter** action for this agent.
  - Connect the three agents (`trend_agent`, `competitor_agent`, `sentiment_agent`) as tools for this main agent.

## Example Workflow

The following steps illustrate how the agent and MCP servers interact to produce a market intelligence report:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Agent calls Data Ingestion MCP to pull data from APIs/web into Azure Data Lake.
2. **Data Analysis**: Agent requests Analytics MCP to analyze trends or summarize sentiment using Synapse.
3. **Text Insights**: Agent uses Text Analytics MCP to extract sentiment/key phrases from social media/news.
4. **Summary**: Agent compiles and presents actionable market intelligence.

---

## Example MCP Actions

Here are some example actions that the agent may call on the MCP servers:
- `ingest_market_data(source_url)`
- `analyze_trends(time_range, metric)`
- `summarize_sentiment(dataset_id)`
- `extract_key_phrases(text_blob)`

---

## Agent-MCP Interaction (Pseudocode)

The pseudocode below demonstrates how the main agent coordinates with the MCP servers to generate a report:

```python
# Pseudocode for agent workflow
market_data = mcp.data_ingestion.ingest_market_data(source_url)
trend_report = mcp.analytics.analyze_trends(market_data, metric="sales")
sentiment = mcp.text_analytics.summarize_sentiment(market_data)
key_phrases = mcp.text_analytics.extract_key_phrases(market_data)
summary = agent.compile_report(trend_report, sentiment, key_phrases)
```

> [!WARNING]
> It should be noted that this is a conceptual overview. Actual implementation will require specific Azure SDKs and configurations. This example is meant to illustrate how MCP can be applied in a market intelligence scenario, not as an exact codebase.
