# Day 2: Azure AI Foundry Hands-on

Welcome to Day 2 of the **Azure AI Foundry Agent Webinar Series**! Today is all about practical experience—building, configuring, and deploying your own AI agent using Azure AI Foundry.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of Day 2, you will:

- Set up your Azure AI Foundry environment.
- Build and configure a basic AI agent.
- Deploy and test your agent in the Agent Playground.
- Understand the workflow from theory to hands-on implementation.

---

## 🛠️ Hands-on Guide

Follow the step-by-step instructions to create your first Azure AI Agent:

👉 [How to Create an Agent (Step-by-Step Guide)](./how-to-create-agent.md)

This guide will walk you through:
- Setting up your Azure AI Foundry account
- Creating and configuring an agent
- Deploying your agent
- Testing and iterating in the Agent Playground

## 📚 About the Use Cases

A major highlight of Day 2 is the exploration of real-world **MCP (Model Context Protocol) use cases**. These use cases demonstrate how Azure-based agents can solve practical problems using modular, composable architectures.

### 🔎 Explore the Use Cases

- Each use case is documented in detail in the [`use-cases/`](./use-cases/) folder.
- For each use case, you'll find:
  - **Description**: What problem does the agent solve?
  - **Azure MCP Architecture**: How does the solution leverage Azure services and MCP servers?
  - **Workflow & Diagrams**: Visual breakdowns of agent interactions and data flow.
  - **Example Actions & Pseudocode**: How the agent calls MCP actions.
  - **Resource Links**: Learn more about the Azure services used.

#### Featured Use Cases
- End-to-End Podcast Producer
- Autonomous Market Intelligence Agent
- Auto-Curriculum Builder
- Local Optimization Agent
- SKU Intelligence Agent (Hybrid Cloud)

## 🚀 Advanced: Agentic RAG Code Samples

For those interested in more advanced applications, explore code samples demonstrating Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using Semantic Kernel and ChromaDB.

### What is Agentic RAG?
Agentic RAG is a project that showcases how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) can be combined with agentic workflows. Using Semantic Kernel and ChromaDB, this project demonstrates how to:
- Retrieve travel documents and relevant data
- Augment user queries with semantic search results
- Stream detailed, context-aware travel recommendations

This approach is especially useful in real-world scenarios—such as the travel domain—where users need accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant information.

## ⏭️ Next Steps

- Continue to [Day 3: Model Context Protocol](../day-3/README.md) to learn about integrating and deploying agents with MCP.
- In the next session, you'll participate in a live Q&A and discuss best practices for building and deploying AI agents with Azure AI Foundry.
