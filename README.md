## ‚≠ê About the Use Cases

A key part of this series is the exploration of real-world **MCP (Model Context Protocol) use cases**. These use cases show how Azure-based agents can solve practical problems using modular, composable architectures.

- Each use case is documented in detail in [`day-2/use-cases/`](./day-2/use-cases/).
- For each use case, you'll find:
  - **Description**: What problem does the agent solve?
  - **Azure MCP Architecture**: How does the solution leverage Azure services and MCP servers?
  - **Workflow & Diagrams**: Visual breakdowns of agent interactions and data flow.
  - **Example Actions & Pseudocode**: How the agent calls MCP actions.
  - **Resource Links**: Learn more about the Azure services used.
