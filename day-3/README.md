# Day 3: MCP & Deployment

Welcome to Day 3 of the **Azure AI Foundry Agent Webinar Series**! Today, you'll learn about MCP (Model Context Protocol) prebuilt servers, how they simplify agent deployment, and how to use them in real-world scenarios.

---

## üéØ Objectives

By the end of Day 3, you will:
- Understand what MCP (Model Context Protocol) is and why it matters
- Explore prebuilt MCP servers and their use cases
- Learn how to deploy and connect agents to MCP servers
- Get hands-on with a deployment workflow

## üß© What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard for connecting AI agents and applications to a variety of models and tools, enabling flexible, modular, and scalable AI solutions.

- **Prebuilt MCP servers** provide ready-to-use endpoints for common AI tasks (e.g., retrieval, summarization, Q&A)
- They allow you to quickly integrate advanced capabilities into your agents without building everything from scratch

For a deep dive into MCP architecture and concepts, see [mcp.md](./mcp.md).

## üöÄ Hands-on: Using MCP Prebuilt Servers

1. **Explore available MCP servers** in Azure AI Foundry or via the [MCP Servers GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
2. **Connect your agent** to a prebuilt server using the Azure AI Foundry portal or SDK
3. **Test your agent** with the new capabilities (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation, document Q&A)

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Workflow

- Select a prebuilt MCP server (e.g., retrieval, summarization)
- Configure your agent to use the MCP endpoint
- Deploy and test the agent in the playground
- Monitor and iterate as needed
