# AI Agents: Concepts and Types

This document provides a deeper dive into the fundamentals of AI agents, their core components, and the different types you may encounter in real-world applications.

## What Are AI Agents?

An **AI Agent** is an intelligent system that can:
- **Reason** about its environment
- **Plan** actions based on goals
- **Act** autonomously to achieve desired outcomes

It interacts dynamically with its environment, unlike traditional models that only respond to input.

> **Example**: A travel agent that books flights, answers questions, and improves over time.

## Core Components of an Agent

| Component      | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Environment** | The world in which the agent operates (e.g., flight data, weather APIs) |
| **Sensors**     | Tools to perceive the environment (e.g., data inputs, APIs) |
| **Actuators**   | Mechanisms to act on the environment (e.g., output responses, service calls) |
| **LLM (Brain)** | A large language model (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) that reasons and makes decisions |

These components work together to **create a feedback loop**, enabling the agent to learn and improve.

## Types of Agents

- **Simple Reflex Agents**: React to current situations based on condition-action rules.
- **Model-Based Reflex Agents**: Maintain internal state models to inform decisions.
- **Goal-Based Agents**: Plan actions to achieve defined goals.
- **Utility-Based Agents**: Choose actions based on preferences and trade-offs.
- **Learning Agents**: Learn from experience and improve performance.
- **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)**: Multiple agents working together or independently.

## When Are AI Agents Effective?

AI agents excel in:
- **Open-Ended Problems**: Dynamic problem-solving without predefined paths.
- **Multi-Step Processes**: Tasks requiring tool interactions and sequential actions.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Scenarios where agents learn from feedback.
